# semantic-graph-matching

### Overview
This folder contains an implementation of semantic matching based on a Bag of Semantic approach, where two
nodes of a pose-graph are matched together by analyzing which semantic landmarks have been observed by each pose.

### Extendibility
The code implemented in this repository can be used to test new ideas for semantic matching,
by expending the way each pose node represents the semantic landmarks registered on a map
(either Bag of Semantics, a hierarchical structure, a graph-based structure etc.)
