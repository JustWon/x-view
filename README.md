# X-View
This repository contains projects related to X-View. In particular the folders in this directory are the following:
* [topograph-matching](topograph-matching/README.md) computes semantic similarities between nodes contained in a graph structure and applies virtual forces to the graph-nodes in order to match them
* [wordnet-examples](wordnet-examples/README.md) shows how one can query semantic similarity measures on the wordnet database.
* [g2o-examples](g2o-examples/README.md) contains some tests exploring the g2o library for graph optimization
* [gtsam-examples](gtsam-examples/README.md) constains some tests exploring the GTSAM library for graph optimization
* [semantic-map-matching](semantic-map-matching/README.md) Simulates a small 2D planar grid-style word where two robots explore the map and observe semantic landmarks. Those landmarks are used to perform node-matching on a semantic level by performing a voting scheme
